# War-VIPER

## Introduction 

This repository contains a re-implementation of the *War* card game, originally from the [Code with Chris](http://codewithchris.com) introduction to Swift. The original implementation uses the MVC design pattern; this reimplementation refactors that code to a VIPER-based design patter. For more on VIPER see [Architecting iOS Apps with VIPER](https://www.objc.io/issues/13-architecture/viper/).
